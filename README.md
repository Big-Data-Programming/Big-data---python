## 📌 Project Overview

Doodle, a globally renowned tech company, traditionally relies on recruitment agencies to hire developers, senior developers, and solution architects. To streamline and innovate their hiring process, Doodle aims to **build an automated in-house solution** that identifies top talent based on their digital presence—especially on platforms like **GitHub** and **Stack Overflow**.

The system is intended to operate **secretively**, analyzing public data and automatically notifying selected candidates—eliminating manual screening entirely.
